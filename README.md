# 🏥 Diabetic Patients Readmission Analytics
This project predicts 30-day hospital readmissions for diabetes patients using machine learning. Leveraging the [Diabetes 130-US Hospitals dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/296/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008), I'm building a data pipeline using dbt and BigQuery to engineer clinical features including prior hospital visits, medication changes, and number of lab procedures performed per day. The project will implement Random Forest and Logistic Regression models to identify readmitted patients, providing actionable insights for healthcare providers to reduce preventable readmissions.

## 💡 Purpose
A learning project to develop practical skills in healthcare analytics and modern data engineering. The project explores clinical risk factors and demonstrates how predictive models can help healthcare providers identify readmitted patients and allocate intervention resources effectively.
